## Setup your dev environment

### Install NodeJS

Visit the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) site and follow the instructions to download and install the recommended version for your operating system.

### Install Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. When you install a Gatsby “starter” site, Gatsby uses Git behind the scenes to download and install the required files for your starter. You will need to have Git installed to set up your first Gatsby site.

The steps to download and install Git depend on your operating system. Follow the guide for your system:

- [Install Git on macOS](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#mac-os-x)
- [Install Git on Windows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows)
- [Install Git on Linux](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#linux)

> You will not need to know Git to complete this tutorial, but it is a very useful tool.

### Using the Gatsby CLI

The Gatsby CLI tool lets you quickly create new Gatsby-powered sites and run commands for developing Gatsby sites. It is a published npm package.

The Gatsby CLI is available via npm and should be installed globally by running `npm install -g gatsby-cli`.

To see the commands available to run `gatsby --help`.

### Create your Website

Now you are ready to use the Gatsby CLI tool to create your first Gatsby site. Using the tool, you can download “starters” (partially built sites with some default configuration) to help you get moving faster on creating a certain type of site.

1. Open up your terminal.
2. Run `gatsby new project-name https://github.com/alfrekjv/gatsby-starter-blank`.
3. Run `cd website`.
4. Run `gatsby develop`.
